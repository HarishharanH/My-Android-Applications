# My-Weather-App
## Introduction
I have created a Weather showing APP called Weather App.
This app has been created by using kotlin in android studio.

## Concepts Been Implemented

I have used kotlin concepts such as, 
            1.importing classes and overridinng functions from parent class.
            2.created some "inner class" and 3.created new "fun" and "Named Parameter". 
            4.It has "exception handling".and "Null Safety". 
            5.and added "try and catch" concept.
            6. It has "Internet Connection" it uses url response for getting the live weather report.
